        "[Voyage](https://huggingface.co/openvoyage/voyage-v1) is basically a _text to image_ model developed by [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://haghiri75.com) and it is based on weights from Stable Diffusion version 2.0 and Midjourney version 4. This model helps creative people turn their ideas to artwork for free (in any sense of the word _free_). \n",
